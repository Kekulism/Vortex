A simple mod that removes the pixelation effect from Balatro's backgrounds!

I've seen people post videos of the Balatro background without the pixelation effect, since a lot of people really like the look of it and wanted to use it as a desktop background, but for some reason no one had made an accessible mod for it. So here's this! There's almost nothing to it, this mod simply replaces the background shaders with an edited version that removes the pixelation effect.
This mod is compatible with any other mods that change the background colors, like [Cryptid](github.com/MathIsFun0/Cryptid) or [Cardsauce](https://github.com/BarrierTrio/Cardsauce).
If you wanna go crazy with making your own custom swirling balatro vortex desktop background, i reccomend getting [DebugPlus](https://github.com/WilsontheWolf/DebugPlus) and [Cardsauce](https://github.com/BarrierTrio/Cardsauce) and setting the background colors to your liking, then hide the UI with H!

## Installation

This mod requires [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and the latest version of [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded). Without these dependencies, this mod will not function.

Once you've installed both lovely and Steammodded, download the latest release zip file from the **Releases** tab and put the folder inside it in your Balatro Mods folder (`%APPDATA%/Balatro/Mods`). That's it!
